# AtliQ-Mart-Supply-Chain-Service-Level-Insights
Built a Power BI dashboard for AtliQ Mart to analyze supply chain service levels. Tracked On-Time, In-Full, OTIF%, Line Fill Rate, and Volume Fill Rate across cities, customers, and products, enabling management to identify gaps vs targets and improve customer satisfaction


The AtliQ Mart – Supply Chain Service Level Insights Dashboard was designed to help the company evaluate and improve its order fulfillment performance. Using Power BI, I built metrics such as On-Time, In-Full, OTIF%, Line Fill Rate (LIFR), and Volume Fill Rate (VOFR) to measure service levels against targets. The dashboard enables daily, weekly, and monthly tracking with drill-down options, providing city-level and customer-level breakdowns. A matrix view with conditional formatting highlights gaps vs targets, while dynamic metric switches allow users to toggle between KPIs without clutter. Product-level analysis includes LIFR and VOFR with sparklines for quick comparisons. By combining stakeholder requirements with additional insights, the solution empowers AtliQ Mart’s management to identify weak areas, enhance customer satisfaction, and make data-driven supply chain decisions more effectively.
